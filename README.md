Previously on Andro Root, I have Posted a tutorial on How to make an Android Controlled Robot.It was for beginners and it is having fewer functions and was very easy to build.Now I am planning for something bigger and better with lots of cool functions. Basically, AndroBot is an Android Controlled Advanced Robot and it is a combination of Android Controlled Rover With Robotics Arm.
